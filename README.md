## What Is The Chess?
Chess is a two-player strategy game played on a chessboard, a checkered board consisting of 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. There are several versions of the types of games that people play all over the world. In this design problem, we will focus on designing a two-player online chess game. 

## About The System
The system supports two online players to play a game of chess and complies with all international chess rules. Each player is assigned black and white and each side will start with 8 pawns, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, 1 queen and 1 king.

## Built With
As a result of our research, an interface and database design could be made with MongoDB with a server connection, or we could perform our operations over a local database with tkinter.
Python's Tkinter library was used in the GUI (Graphical User Interface) part of our project. In addition, the SQLite database engine in Python was used, so all data was brought together with this system.

## From in App
In the login section, a "Log In" tab welcomes us. If you have an account, you log in, if you don't, you can register by clicking the "Register" button. There is also a "Reset Password" button on the login tab. In this way, if you forgot your password, you can reset it with this button.
After successfully logging into the system, you will be greeted by a Main Screen. On this screen, "New Game", "Ongoing Games", "How to Play" and "Account Settings" button will appear. With the Account Settings button, you can change the username and password of your account if you wish. The how to play section takes you to the learning section of chess.com, a very popular online chess site. Thanks to this site, which has a detailed chess learning infrastructure, you can grasp the basics of chess in a short time. The New Game and My Continued Games buttons, as the name suggests, connect you to the game of chess and you can play chess mutually.
